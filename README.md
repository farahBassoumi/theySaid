# Project Structure Note
Normally, in an Nx workspace, apps live inside an /apps folder—this helps keep things organized when you have multiple projects in the same repo. But since this repo only has one app right now, we’ve kept it simple and put it right in the root folder. This keeps the setup straightforward and easy to work with. If we add more apps or shared code later, we can easily move everything into the usual apps/ and libs/ folders without any hassle.
